  abstract={This paper presents a novel performance evaluation of five key lightweight hash functions on an ATxmega128 microcontroller, using our E-RANK metric as a composite metric that integrates execution speed, memory footprint, and energy efficiency into a unified and balanced ranking. We leverage hardware-specific profiling techniques using the ChipWhisperer FPGA toolkit to capture power traces and execution metrics. The findings offer fine-grained insights into which LWHFs are best suited for constrained IoT environments.},
