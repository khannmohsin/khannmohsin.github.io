I am a cybersecurity researcher at UiT The Arctic University of Norway, focused on building secure, distributed, and intelligent systems for the future of IoT. My doctoral work explores Information Flow Control models and lightweight cryptographic enforcement for IoT trust infrastructure. I architected **DTEA**, a novel blockchain-based access control framework that brings Proof-of-Authority and capability-token logic into distributed deployments.

My work blends theoretical models with practical implementations, using tools like **ChipWhisperer**, **AVR/ARM platforms**, **Prometheus/Grafana**, and **smart contracts on Besu**. Iâ€™m equally passionate about academic excellence and security research that has industrial impact â€” including performance benchmarking, cryptographic evaluation, and real-world trust enforcement for embedded systems.

I enjoy mentoring, speaking, and working across domains like cryptography, edge/fog architectures, and policy-based enforcement. I welcome collaborations, consulting, and contributions to research and open-source security tooling.

ðŸš€ Motto: **Build Systems People Can Trust. Securely. At Scale.**
