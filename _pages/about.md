I am a cybersecurity researcher, where I focus on building secure, distributed, and intelligent systems for the Internet of Things (IoT) and cyber-physical infrastructures.

My research centers around trust enforcement in decentralized systems. I architected **DTEA: Distributed Trust Enforcement Architecture**, a dynamic access control framework combining blockchain, smart contracts, and capability-based tokens under Proof-of-Authority consensus. It enables secure, policy-aware communication across constrained edge, fog, and cloud nodes — aligned with NIST and OpenFog standards.

I have also led extensive benchmarking of lightweight cryptographic primitives for embedded environments. Using **AVR/ARM microcontrollers**, **ChipWhisperer**, and energy profiling techniques, I analyzed 20+ lightweight hash functions and ciphers across speed, memory, and power trade-offs. I introduced composite metrics to evaluate and rank these primitives under real-world constraints. 

I have conducted a comprehensive survey of 116 lightweight cryptographic ciphers, covering 57 block ciphers, 33 stream ciphers, 5 hybrid constructions, and 21 elliptic curve implementations. The survey systematically examines each algorithm’s architecture, year of publication, known vulnerabilities, and implementation trade-offs across both software and hardware contexts. By analyzing performance, security margins, and resource utilization, the study highlights strengths, weaknesses, and gaps across the lightweight cryptography landscape — serving as a decision-making guide for constrained and high-assurance environments.

My technical toolkit includes **Python**, **C/C++**, **embedded Linux**, **Prometheus/Grafana**, and **Solidity-based smart contracts on Besu**. I blend formal threat modeling (STRIDE) with hands-on system implementation, and contribute to open-source efforts in secure IoT design.

Alongside my doctoral work, I bring a multidisciplinary background from my Master’s in Computer Science and Technology and MBA in Operations, which enriched my understanding of both technical systems and organizational strategy. During my Master’s, I developed intelligent systems using IoT, CAV-VANET models, and real-time traffic optimization, while publishing in peer-reviewed venues. My MBA training complemented this by grounding me in operations research, risk analysis, project management, and strategic decision-making — essential skills for designing scalable, mission-driven security solutions in complex environments. Together, these foundations fuel my ability to build systems that are not only secure, but also aligned with operational priorities and real-world constraints.

Before transitioning into research, I worked as a Data Engineer at Blackbuck Insight, where I migrated critical data pipelines to AWS cloud infrastructure, reducing query latency and improving scalability. There, I developed expertise in MapReduce, PySpark, HDFS, and cloud-native data workflows—skills I now integrate into secure IoT infrastructures.

Currently, I am expanding my research toward quantum-safe cryptography, attending workshops and delivering talks on post-quantum fundamentals to prepare for next-generation threats.
